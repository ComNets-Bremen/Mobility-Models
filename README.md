# Mobility-Models

The [ORBIT Mobilty Model (SOLAR)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589669) and the 
[Comunity-based Mobility Model (CMM)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/papers/realman06.pdf) are synthetic mobility models 
to simulate mobility of nodes in ad-hoc networks. The code in this repository is an implementation of these
models for the [INET Framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org) of the [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org) simulator.

Here are the most important links to these models working.

1. Requirements - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

2. Install OMNeT++, INET Framework and the mobility models (SOLAR and CMM) - [Install and Build](#install-and-build)

3. Run models - [Running Models](#running-models)




## Prerequisites

These models have been tested on the following versions of INET and OMNeT++.

- OMNeT Version 5.5.1
- INET Framework version 4.1.1


## Install and Build

Follow the following procedure to install and build the models.

1. Install and build [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org)

2. Create a new workspace in the OMNeT++ IDE

3. Install and build the [INET Framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org) in the created workspace

4. Copy all the files of the two subfolders (`examples` and `src`) in to the freshly installed INET, maintaining 
the same folder hierarchy 

5. Rebuild INET



## Running Models

1. Use the omnetpp.ini files provided in the examples for SOLAR and CMM to run the mobility models

Here are some important information.

- To run the mobility models with random configurations, set the `isRandom` (for CMM), `isProbabilityRandom` 
(for SOLAR) and `isPositionRandom` (for SOLAR) variables to true in the `omnetpp.ini`

- To run the mobility models with pre-calculated matrices, set `address` (for CMM), `probabilityAddress` (for SOLAR)
and `positionAddress` (for SOLAR) to the locations of the CSV files of the matrices. Examples are given in the 
`cmm_parameters` and `solar_parameters` folders. The order of the file names are the selection (execution) order.
