1. Make sure that you have inet4 and it is in your workspace folder
2. Copy the 3 folders into your workspace folder (Select Merge)
3. If you want to try the mobility models with random configuration, change the omnetpp.ini to true in the variables isRandom (for CMM), isProbabilityRandom (for SOLAR), and isPositionRandom (for SOLAR).
4. If you want to run the mobility models with precalculated matrices, check in omnetpp.ini the parameters address (for CMM), probabilityAddress (for SOLAR), and positionAddress (for SOLAR) and change the path /home/leonardo/Desktop/w_comnets to the path of your workspace folder. (The name of the files is the execution order).
5. Enjoy!
